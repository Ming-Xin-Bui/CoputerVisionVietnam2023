To test it locally on localhost:8080, run on the terminal from the project root:  
&emsp; "python -m venv venv" (to create or update virtual environment folder)  
&emsp; "venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1" (to run venv on windows, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for other os)  
&emsp; "pip install -r requirements.txt" (install all dependencies)  
&emsp; "python main.py" (to run the actual server)

Also in this repo, there's a ipynb file for a google colab version at the root directory.  
  
And here's the newest version of the program in notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DM5rjbe9JoJiv4S0zyfe7atq7mswpYWC?usp=sharing.
