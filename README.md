Note that because the program was with GPU acceleration in mind and buying rights to use GPU is too expensive for this project.
This program didn't take the limitations of memory usage in mind, which leads to google cloud not executing the program after "/processing", since google cloud app engine only allows around 3000MiB of memory for an instance to use, but this program uses up to 10GB.  
Getting rights to use the gcloud app engine and reforming the program to comform to gcloud saftey and stability measures to except for memory usage by Ming Xin Bui, 2022T049.
